- Added a package of 15 brand new maps:

- Andrast (2p)
Probably the most-played map in the 1vs1 Winter Tournament, we now provide the non-winter version as an official map. Thanks to Rimli for letting us use this!

- Carnen (2p)
Another fairly balanced map that was introduced with the Winter Tournament, Carnen returns without snow. Credits to m@tt for making this awesome map!

- Carrock (2p)
A great map provided to us by BadMadMax. This map was picked quite often during the Winter Tournament and we're proud to announce that it made it in the patch with a few improvements:
- Removed snow
- Removed some props from fords to avoid getting stuck frequently
- Added another ford to the river at the very top right edge and updated the mini map

- Drúwaith Iaur Winter Edition (2p)
Opposed to other maps from the Winter Tournament, this map keeps its snowy appearance. Credits go to Naugrim.

- Iron Hills (3p)
This 3-player FFA map will be the first 3-player map with camps as starting points. Thanks to _Haldir_, who allowed us to distribute this map with this patch.

- Tharbad (3p)
This FFA map, also by _Haldir_, features a ruined city with a central outpost, surrounded by castle walls.

- Eregion (4p)
Without a doubt the most-unique 2vs2 map there is up until now, players start out with either a camp or a castle, depending on their position. Credits to Lex Flores.

- Fords of Bruinen (4p)
Another map provided by m@tt. With only one way to the enemy and many expansion points, this map is another interesting addition to the 2vs2 map pool.

- Old Ford of Anduin (4p)
Probably the most 'normal' 2vs2 map in this expansion, this map is vertically divided by a river in the middle. Again, credits for this map go to m@tt.

- Desolation of Smaug (5p)
This map is an alternative to the (till now) only 5-player map Belfalas. Players on this map start with camps. Thanks to _Haldir_ for providing this extremely balanced map.

- Dimrill Dale (6p)
Being the very first 3vs3 map with castles as starting positions, we hope this map will surprise many 3vs3 players in a positive way. Thanks to m@tt for letting us distribute this!

- Lossarnach (6p)
This is another special 3vs3 map which features a big, awesome city in its center. The map was made by _Haldir_.

- South Rhun (6p)
An interesting 3vs3 map which plays top right vs. bottom left. Outposts in the top left and bottom right are the only expansion points. Thanks to Dennis Agodzo.

- Minhiriath (7p)
The very first 7-player map in the entire map pool. The starting positions circle around a great valley in the middle, with a bridge over it. Thanks to _Haldir_ for providing us with this map.

- Lamedon (8p)
Additional to Old Brown Lands, this map is another 8-player map with castles. Played left vs. right, this map is divided vertically by a river in the middle. Credits go to TheFoeHammer.
