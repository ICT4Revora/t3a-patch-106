IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Anything in this file besides what is written in "" must *not* be changed!
Replace every text line by your translation, using the exact same format.
Do not modify the line above and under the text encapsulated by "".

It is important to keep the "\n" symbols approximately where they are.
They add a new line which means the text after "\n" is written on a new
line. Also, don't use any other special characters as the ones used.
The question mark "?" may NOT be changed. Eg "(?C) Outpost" may be changed
to "(?C) TranslationOfOutpost". Do not translate any URL adresses, they are
here for completeness.
Mapnames (when it is a location) and Credit tags should be kept as they are!

Save and send the translated file as translationsYourLanguage.txt.

If you have any more questions please ask before acting.

Other strings you don't have to translate:
